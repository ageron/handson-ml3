Therefore, it is not continuous at that point, and thus not differentiable either.\n",
    "* The function must not have a **breaking point** at $x_\\mathrm{A}$, meaning that the slope that the $(\\mathrm{AB})$ line approaches as $\\mathrm{B}$ approaches $\\mathrm{A}$ must be the same whether $\\mathrm{B}$ approaches from the left side or from the right side. We already saw a counterexample with $f(x)=|x|$, which is both defined and continuous at $x_\\mathrm{A}=0$, but which has a breaking point at $x_\\mathrm{A}=0$: the slope of the curve $y=|x|$ is -1 on the left, and +1 on the right.\n",
    "* The curve $y=f(x)$ must not be **vertical** at point $\\mathrm{A}$. One counterexample is $f(x)=\\sqrt[3]{x}$, the cubic root of $x$: the curve is vertical at the origin, so the function is not differentiable at $x_\\mathrm{A}=0$, as you can see in the following animation:"

    "When trying to optimize a function $f(x)$, we look for the values of $x$ that minimize (or maximize) the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that when a function reaches a minimum or maximum, assuming it is differentiable at that point, the derivative will necessarily be equal to 0. For example, you can check the above animation, and notice that whenever the function $f$ (in the upper graph) reaches a maximum or minimum, then the derivative $f'$ (in the lower graph) is equal to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "So one way to optimize a function is to differentiate it and analytically find all the values for which the derivative is 0, then determine which of these values optimize the function (if any). For example, consider the function $f(x)=\\dfrac{1}{4}x^4 - x^2 + \\dfrac{1}{2}$. Using the derivative rules (specifically, the sum rule, the product rule, the power rule and the constant rule), we find that $f'(x)=x^3 - 2x$. We look for the values of $x$ for which $f'(x)=0$, so $x^3-2x=0$, and therefore $x(x^2-2)=0$. So $x=0$, or $x=\\sqrt2$ or $x=-\\sqrt2$. As you can see on the following graph of $f(x)$, these 3 values correspond to local extrema. Two global minima $f\\left(\\sqrt2\\right)=f\\left(-\\sqrt2\\right)=-\\dfrac{1}{2}$ and one local maximum $f(0)=\\dfrac{1}{2}$.\n"

Note that a curve could be going upwards (i.e., $f'(x)>0$) but also be accelerating downwards (i.e., $f''(x) < 0$): for example, imagine the path of a stone thrown upwards, as it is being slowed down by gravity (which constantly accelerates the stone downwards).\n",

    "## Gradient Descent, revisited\n",
    "\n",
    "In Deep Learning, the Gradient Descent algorithm we discussed earlier is based on gradients instead of derivatives (hence its name). It works in much the same way, but using vectors instead of scalars: simply start with a random vector $\\mathbf{x}_0$, then compute the gradient of $f$ at that point, and perform a small step in the opposite direction, then repeat until convergence. More precisely, at each step $t$, compute $\\mathbf{x}_t = \\mathbf{x}_{t-1} - \\eta \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}_{t-1})$. The constant $\\eta$ is the learning rate, typically a small value such as $10^{-3}$. In practice, we generally use more efficient variants of this algorithm, but the general idea remains the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Deep Learning, the letter $\\mathbf{x}$ is generally used to represent the input data. When you _use_ a neural network to make predictions, you feed the neural network the inputs $\\mathbf{x}$, and you get back a prediction $\\hat{y} = f(\\mathbf{x})$. The function $f$ treats the model parameters as constants. We can use more explicit notation by writing $\\hat{y} = f_\\mathbf{w}(\\mathbf{x})$, where $\\mathbf{w}$ represents the model parameters and indicates that the function relies on them, but treats them as constants.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when _training_ a neural network, we do quite the opposite: all the training examples are grouped in a matrix $\\mathbf{X}$, all the labels are grouped in a vector $\\mathbf{y}$, and both $\\mathbf{X}$ and $\\mathbf{y}$ are treated as constants, while $\\mathbf{w}$ is treated as variable: specifically, we try to minimize the cost function $\\mathcal L_{\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{y}}(\\mathbf{w}) = g(f_{\\mathbf{X}}(\\mathbf{w}), \\mathbf{y})$, where $g$ is a function that measures the \"discrepancy\" between the predictions $f_{\\mathbf{X}}(\\mathbf{w})$ and the labels $\\mathbf{y}$, where $f_{\\mathbf{X}}(\\mathbf{w})$ represents the vector containing the predictions for each training example. Minimizing the loss function is usually performed using Gradient Descent (or a variant of GD): we start with random model parameters $\\mathbf{w}_0$, then we compute $\\nabla \\mathcal L(\\mathbf{w}_0)$ and we use this gradient vector to perform a Gradient Descent step, then we repeat the process until convergence. It is crucial to understand that the gradient of the loss function is with regards to the model parameters $\\mathbf{w}$ (_not_ the inputs $\\mathbf{x}$)."
